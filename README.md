# Todo
- Make tabs responsive

# Adding languages
- First look into the ``languages/en.json`` and ``languages/de.json`` and copy one of them
- Then translate everything
- If you are finished go into the ``js/controller/settings.json`` and add your language (like the other two) to the ``$scope.languages``-Array
  - The short name must be equally to the file name
  - The full name is for the settings on the website
